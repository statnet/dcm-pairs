Deterministic Compartmental Pair Formation Model

This is a developmental version of a "pair formation" model in the deterministic compartmental framework, in which persons are modeled as entering and exiting sexual partnerships (pairs). This is very much a work in progress and questions may be directed to sjenness@uw.edu.
